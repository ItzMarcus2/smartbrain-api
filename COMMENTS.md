## CORS

CORS is what you would set to allow or disallow requests from different origins e.g. so you only allow requests coming from the app you deployed on heroku, as current I could take the API endpoints and post directly to them from the console, JsFiddle etc.. :) 

## Validate input

I also noticed that I were able to register with a fake email or as in not an actual email, tried with just my name and that seemed to work :D


I could probably come up with some more comments but also let me know what you want more feedback on, code styles, patterns, security etc.. ? :)
